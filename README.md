# Hypertension Risk Prediction (Advanced Python Project)

## Overview
This project used machine learning techniques in Python to develop a model that predicts the risk of hypertension based on multiple patient health factors. It involved preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning algorithms.

## Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Skills Demonstrated
- Feature Engineering
- Data Preprocessing & Normalization
- Logistic Regression Modeling
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## Project Steps
1. Imported patient-level dataset with health indicators (BMI, cholesterol, physical activity).
2. Cleaned and normalized the data.
3. Split data into train/test sets.
4. Trained a logistic regression model to predict hypertension risk.
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
6. Visualized key trends in patient data using plots.

## Outcome
Achieved reliable prediction accuracy for hypertension risk using a minimal dataset. Enabled early identification of high-risk individuals for targeted interventions.
